              "2  If I could give them a negative star or no stars on this review I would. I have never worked with any industry with as bad of customer service as Comcast. It is not a matter of money because I make well enough above and beyond to afford their services but they are a legitimate ripoff. I think they are the biggest scam of since the mortgage industry's major meltdown and I hope I move somewhere where Comcast does not exist. The disregard to want to help or do the right thing is honestly astounding. If you have to call, which you do FOR ALL ISSUES - billing, connection/service, adding or removing service, errors, it does not matter you will be transferred minimum of 4 times. Everyone says the same thing and passes the issues to the next person and no one resolves the problem.They offer promotional packages in small timeframes and can never access them again so they then upgrade you without you wishing and change your billing. It has been 5 months and I have been overcharged $40 a month since I started with them. The blatant rudeness that must make you qualified to do this job is the type of quality service that gets you this review. So... Dear Comcast, you suck. Sincerely, a customer who cannot wait to never use your service again.  \n",

Nothing but problems. Two no shows on scheduled service appointments, extreme difficulty in adding boxes to the second floor. What is so difficult about adding boxes to an existing account? No thank you, I'm not starting a second account for the second floor of the same house! A separate bundle package? All I wanted was just to add a few boxes. Apparently this is not possible. Well then, I guess it's not possible to remain a customer!  \n",

I signed up for $49.99 150Mbps internet for 2 years, however my contract has $19.99 for 25Mbps internet for 2 years. They say there is an add on in place for $30 which boost it to Blast! Pro, however this isn't part of the contract, which means that Comcast can increase the price whenever they want within the 2 years. This means I haven't received the advertised rate. Comcast has so far refused to issue corrected contract, or issue in writing that the $30 will remain at that price for 2 years. I just have to trust them. So watch out, Comcast is doing the usual illegal practices, I'm guessing to catch people out and hope they don't notice and end up paying more than they should.  "

I think they are the biggest scam of since the mortgage industry's major meltdown and I hope I move somewhere where Comcast does not exist. The disregard to want to help or do the right thing is honestly astounding. If you have to call, which you do FOR ALL ISSUES - billing, connection/service, adding or removing service, errors, it does not matter you will be transferred minimum of 4 times. Everyone says the same thing and passes the issues to the next person and no one resolves the problem.They offer promotional packages in small timeframes and can never access them again so they then upgrade you without you wishing and change your billing. It has been 5 months and I have been overcharged $40 a month since I started with them. The blatant rudeness that must make you qualified to do this job is the type of quality service that gets you this review. So... Dear Comcast, you suck.

I explained that my OnDemand service was not working and pointed out that I have had to call every month because of service problems.  I asked to speak with someone with technical expertise or a person with decision-making authority.  I was told that a manager would call me within 30 minutes but no one ever called.I continue to pay for a service that simply does not work.  It is fraud or perhaps theft.  Comcast advertises a service and I pay for it.  More than 50 percent of the time that I try to access it, the service does not work.  I have made dozens of service calls and I have had more than a dozen technicians visit my home in a year and a half but the service still does not work.  I feel that Comcast is falsely advertising or perhaps committing fraud.  The company says that it can deliver a service.  A customer pays for the service, yet the service is not delivered.  I don't understand how they get away with this.\",\n          \"I pay so much for Comcast and their so-called premium channels. The \\\"FREE\\\" movies from premium channels are very outdated and limited. If there are new movies they're either documentaries or movies that went straight to video.\",\n          \"I would like to give Comcast NEGATIVE stars... So many negative stars that Comcast actually owes me stars. First off, when I signed up at the business in Nowheresville, Illinois, I had asked if I could get service immediately. The representative had claimed yes, YOU can. Famous last words. She had got on her tablet and stated that someone already had a Comcast account at my address. She asked me to retype my address. Fair enough, I did. Afterwards her tablet provides info that says the same thing. She calls over her Russian supervisor who claims that I put in the wrong address. I stated \\\"No, I have put it in twice and it is correct.\\\" The man proceeded to ask me for my license to show my address. It should have been a red flag right there.I'm ok with showing my driver's license. No problem. Except the fact that I live in Ohio and go to school in Illinois. I was renting a place during the school year and desired television and internet. When I refused to show my Driver's license, the supervisor called me a liar and later asked if I was supposed to have a place in the States. After I explained it to him that I was a student, he pulled up my address and the file had said that someone had started service at my address 2 weeks prior. I had to explain I just moved there 3 days earlier. So we finally get that figured out. The supervisor had thought that the other account was put on the wrong address. Whatever figured it out.So I go home, install the equipment myself through their somewhat adequate automatic voice command software providing installment advise. After I installed the internet modem, I began installing the cable box. The cable box equipment didn't work. Called Comcast 1-800 number and the lady understood and sent me a new box \\\"free of charge.\\\"Then I go home, install the new box and I had to call the 1-800 number and have them turn on the box. However when I called, I had a bunch of registration errors because the box I had was not on my account. Kept saying wrong equipment number. After pressing 15 different numbers, the robot voice might actual turn out to be someone who works there so I could explain what I needed. Got the equipment number changed for my account info. Good to go, right? Wrong. I was supposed to take my old box and place in shipping boxes that were provided \\\"free of charge\\\" and take the box to UPS and have them ship it out to Comcast itself. I take it to UPS and they state the postage on the box is for the wrong amount and force me to pay $6.45 to ship Comcast's mistake back to them. Whatever. It's $6... What's that?... like 6 tacos from Taco Bell. Good to go then, right?Wrong. I continue to get service and pay my bills on time I might add, but at month three, I start getting endless letters for unpaid bills. Question mark goes up in my head so I call Comcast again. Long story short, these unpaid bills came from the account that they had mistakenly put on my address. Remember the guy who called me a liar and said that someone registered service for my address 2 weeks before I moved in. Yeah, those bills weren't getting paid. I was paying my bills, not this fake account on my address. Got that figured out after receiving threats of shutting down my service, which was already paid for. Got that figured out.Months go by and I started noticing that my bills were not for the same amount. 1st month was $105.78, 2nd month was $96.58 (correct amount), 3rd month $98 and change, 4th month was $96.58 (correct amount), etc. it was about month 6 that I figured it out. So I had to call that pesky 1-800 number. Turns out that my bill was being sent from multiple Comcast billing locations. One was including the taxes and fees associated with my state. And the wrong amounts were coming from another state with the taxes and fees associated with their state. Figured that out and they couldn't refund all of the overcharges but gave me money on my account to go towards my next bill. Ok. Whatever. I ended up getting like 84% of the overcharges back... It ended up being the cost of a nice 6-pack. Whatever. Done, right? No more issues, right? Wrong!!! At the end of the year, I needed to return the equipment and drop the service. Fine and dandy. I go to take the equipment back in Illinois on a Saturday. The people there had told me that I did not have all of my equipment. Ok no worries, but I was moving the next day to Tennessee and their offices are not open on Sundays. I go home, grab the one small piece of equipment that I forgot. I call 1-800-Comcast to figure out where the nearest location was to drop off my equipment in Tennessee. They provide the address for me! Yay, something useful. Pack up the equipment and my belongings and move to Tennessee.Go to the address I was provided on that Friday after moving in. Explained I do not need your services, I'm returning your equipment, here you go. The guy at the Tennessee location says ok but this equipment doesn't belong here, it belongs back in Illinois and he agrees to ship it back to Illinois free of charge. He had mentioned that there maybe termination fees involved with my account. Ok, go ahead.Two months go by and I start getting letters forwarded to my new address in Tennessee and Comcast began charging me late fees for not returning my equipment and that I owed interest and all this ** (pardon my language if ladies are reading this). So I call 1-800-STUPID-COMCAST (sarcasm, but I really called Comcast's 1-800 number). They checked their system in Illinois and my equipment was not there. It was sitting in a warehouse in Tennessee and I, not Comcast, had to figure out that it was wasting away in Tennessee via visiting their Tennessee location. Anyway, they ship it to Illinois for it to only sit there for another 2 weeks for them to figure out that my equipment belonged to another location in a different state. Remember at the beginning when my equipment didn't work and they sent me a new equipment box. Yeah my new box came from another warehouse in a different state. Meanwhile I'm hanging in the balance as COMCAST gets their crap together. I ended up with a $433 in late fee and taxes... Now paid after never being late on a single payment. Thanks for letting me now via phone or email Comcast. I had a 760 credit score... Who knows what it is now.BTW, 90% of the people you call on the 1-800 number have no clue what they are doing & those that do are smart enough to find a better work environment. The employees are terrible at taking customer notes. All customers be warned, you will have to repeat your information 50 times each call... You may be hung up on either on accident or on purpose. Some employees are not very good at pressing the hold button.Also Comcast is looking and will screw any person harder than a Philips screw driver on a flathead nail into concrete. Open up your pocket books and create a bank account called \\\"Comcast ** fund\\\" cause you're going to need it. Consider yourself warned. Comcast can take a long walk off a short pier.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
